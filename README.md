# Fraudulent credit classification
In this project I create model that predict the fraudulent  credits transactions. After choosing the best model I also dive in the data and see the correlations of other features to the predicted variable. In this project I've ultilized:
- Basic data analytics process to check the distribution, clean the data and split data into train/test sets in python
- Checking the performance of various model (Random forest, LightBGM, XGBoost) through metrics such as precision, recall, f1-score, roc_auc_score, average_precision_score
- Analyse and choose the best model for each scenario
- Find the feature importance and correlations of feature to the predicted feature for further analysis
